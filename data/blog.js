            "We are excited to launch the Join the Dots blog — a space for reflections, stories, and insights from our community. Here, we will share our experiences with empathic listening, compassionate communication, and the quiet transformations that happen when people truly feel heard.",
            "This blog is for everyone — whether you have been practising NVC for years or are just beginning to explore what it means to listen with your whole heart. We invite you to read, reflect, and share your own thoughts with us.",
            "Stay tuned for articles from our facilitators, community members, and guest writers. Together, we are joining the dots between understanding and connection."

        body: [
            "In our fast-paced world, truly listening to another person has become a rare gift. We often listen to respond rather than to understand. At Join the Dots, we believe that deep listening is the foundation of all meaningful connection.",
            "When someone feels genuinely heard — without judgement, advice, or interruption — something shifts. Defences soften. Trust builds. And the door opens for authentic dialogue.",
            "Our Listening Circles create this space every month, and we have seen firsthand how powerful it can be. If you have never experienced empathic listening, we invite you to join us for a free session and discover what becomes possible when you simply listen."
